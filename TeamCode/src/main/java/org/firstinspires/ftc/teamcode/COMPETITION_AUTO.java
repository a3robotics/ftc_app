     *
     *  DO NOT EDIT THIS AUTO UNLESS YOU ARE 101% SURE YOUR CODE IS CONSISTENT!
     *  DO TESTING AND EXPERIMENTING IN OTHER AUTOS
     *
     *  Basically, this auto should be ready to go anytime with no last minute changes or bug fixes
     *  The last thing we want is to have a bug right before competition because we were
     *  working on new stuff. This auto intends to ensure that consistency by only using proven
     *  code and never experimental features.
     *
     *  If you do not know if you can add your code to this auto, talk to Ben.
     *
     *  Features we want that need to be worked on (programming or mechanical):
     *  - Team marker deposit needs to be developed and tested (15 pts value)
     *  - Tensorflow code needs to be debugged and tested (2/3 * 25 pts value)
     *  - Tensorflow code needs to be encapsulated so it can be called from any auto
     *
     *  TODO: If you're out of ideas for projects, work on one of the above.
